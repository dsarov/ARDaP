Accession	Name	Description
catalyze	catalyze	enzymes that facilitates the movement of transposons
confers_resistance_to	confers_resistance_to	A relationship ontology term in which the subject (e.g. a gene family) confers or contributes to antibiotic resistance to the object (e.g. a drug class). It is a qualitative measure of antibiotic resistance, based on an experiment illustrating elevated MIC even outside of a clinical setting.
confers_resistance_to_drug	confers_resistance_to_drug	A relationship ontology term in which the subject (usually an enzyme, protein or other gene product) confers or contributes to clinically relevant resistance to a specific antibiotic drug.
derives_from	derives_from	A relationship ontology term in which the subject has its origins from the object (paraphrased from Relationship Ontology).
has_part	has_part	A core relation that holds between a whole and its part. The subject has_part object. (paraphrased from Relationship Ontology)
is_a	is_a	An axiomatic relationship ontology term in which the subject is placed into a higher order classification (paraphrased from Relationship Ontology).
participates_in	participates_in	A relation between a continuant and a process, in which the continuant is somehow involved in the process, e.g., this input material (or this output material) participates in this process.
part_of	part_of	A relationship ontology term in which the subject is but part of the object (paraphrased from Relationship Ontology).
regulates	regulates	A relationship ontology term in which the subject regulates expression of the object.
relationship	relationship	A relationship between two ontology terms.
represses	represses	A relationship between a transcriptional regulator and a gene or gene product, in which the regulator is plays a negative role in the transcriptional process.
targeted_by	targeted_by	A relationship ontology term in which the subject is targeted by the object (usually a class of antibiotics).
targeted_by_drug	targeted_by_drug	A relationship ontology term in which the subject is targeted by a specific antibiotic.
