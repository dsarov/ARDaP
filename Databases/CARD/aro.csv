ARO:3000013	vanB	VanB is a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase homolog similar to VanA, and can synthesize D-Ala-D-Lac, an alternative substrate for peptidoglycan synthesis that reduces vancomycin binding affinity. It has been isolated from VREs. It is associated with vancomycin resistance, but not teicoplanin resistance.
ARO:3000014	TEM beta-lactamase	TEM-1 is the most commonly-encountered beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in E. coli is due to the production of TEM-1. Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the ESBL phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to b-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid.  Although the inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of E. coli, but also some strains of K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam-lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, although resistance has been described.
ARO:3000015	SHV beta-lactamase	SHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in K. pneumoniae and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known.
ARO:3000016	CTX-M beta-lactamase	These enzymes were named for their greater activity against cefotaxime than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (eg, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or cefepime). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of Kluyvera species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. Despite their name, a few are more active on ceftazidime than cefotaxime.  CTX-M-15 was recently found in bacterial strains expressing NDM-1 and were responsible for resistance to aztreonam.
ARO:3000017	OXA beta-lactamase	OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d. The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.
ARO:3000018	IMI beta-lactamase	IMI beta-lactamases are a group of TEM-1-like beta-lactamase that are known to hydrolyze imipenem. IMI beta-lactamases are inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam.

ARO:3001219	elfamycin antibiotic	Elfamycins are molecules that inhibit bacterial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a key protein which brings aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Elfamycins defined by their target (EF-Tu), rather than a conserved chemical backbone. Elfamycins follow two mechanisms to disrupt protein synthesis: 1. kirromycins and enacyloxin fix EF-Tu in the GTP bound conformation and lock EF-Tu onto the ribosome, and 2. pulvomycin and GE2270 cover the binding site of aa-tRNA disallowing EF-Tu from being charged with aa-tRNA. All elfamycins cause increased the affinity of EF-Tu for GTP.
ARO:3001220	factumycin	Factumycin is a kirromycin-like antibiotic produced by Kitasatospora setae and Streptomyces strains.

ARO:3001233	pikromycin	Produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439.
ARO:3001234	kirromycin	Kirromycin, also known as mocimycin, is the representative molecule of its own class of elfamycins which is composed of more than 10 analogs. Kirromycin binds to the domain 1,2 interface of elongation factor Tu. This interaction maintains the EF-Tu*GTP conformation even after GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. EF-Tu*GDP normally releases aa-tRNA and then exits the ribosome; however, kirromycin*EF-Tu*GDP*aa-tRNA forms a strong complex and remains bound to the ribosome, prohibits translocation of the peptide chain and translation is halted.
ARO:3001235	aurodox	Aurodox is an elongation factor Tu inhibiting antibiotic. It was first referred to as X-5108. It is produced by Streptomyces goldiniensis var. goldiniensis and is active primarily against gram-positive bacteria.
ARO:3001236	efrotomycin	Efrotomycin is produced by Streptomyces lactamodurans NRRL 3802. This kirromycin-like antibiotic is used in animal agriculture, especially in the production of swine. Generally gram negative bacteria are susceptible to efrotomycin, while gram positive bacteria are resistant.
ARO:3001237	GE2270A	GE2270A is the model molecule of cyclic thiazolyl peptide elfamycins. 
GE2270A is produced by Planobispora rosea. Biosynthesis of the molecule has been shown to originate as a ribosomally synthesized peptide that undergoes significant post-translational modification. Clinical use of cyclic thiazolyl peptides is hindered by their low water solubility and bioavailability.
ARO:3001242	enacyloxin IIa	Enacyloxin IIa is structurally distinct but acts in a similar mechanism to kirromycin-like elfamycins. It prohibits the transfer of the amino acid at the A site to the elongating peptide chain. It is most likely that the mechanism of action is that EF-Tu*GDP is locked in the EF-Tu*GTP form, and EF-Tu*GDP*aa-tRNA is immobilized on the ribosome. It is an open question whether enacyloxin IIa actually belongs to the kirromycin-like group of elfamycins due to their high similarity.
ARO:3001246	kirrothricin	Kirrothricin is produced by Streptomyces cinnamoneus and is structurally related to kirromycin, aurodox, heneicomycin and shares a similar spectrum of antibacterial activity.

ARO:3004446	Haemophilus influenzae PBP3 conferring resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics	PBP3 is a penicillin-binding protein and beta-lactam resistance enzyme encoded by the ftsI gene in Haemophilus influenzae. Mutations in ftsI confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
ARO:3004447	HERA beta-lactamase	A class A beta-lactamase family shown to hydrolyze penicillin but without cephalosporinase activity.
ARO:3004448	HERA-1	A class A beta-lactamase with penicillinase activity described in Atlantibacter (Escherichia) hermannii
ARO:3004449	TRU beta-lactamase	A class C beta-lactamase endogenous to Aeromonas enteropelogenes (tructi)
ARO:3004450	TRU-1	A class C beta-lactamase enzyme identified from Aeromonas enteropelogenes. TRU-1 confers resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.
